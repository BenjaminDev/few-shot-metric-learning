## TODO:
1. check the recall on the train set (Done but looks crap!)
2. get the original implementation up and running (Done and it seems to be working!)
3. write tests for recall, NMI
4. Extract labels for look up
### Nice to haves:
1. Log examples as it trains
2. Log recall and NMI
3. Start writing up the learnings and looking into unlabelled data
